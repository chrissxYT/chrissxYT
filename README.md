### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Amplessimus](https://github.com/Ampless/Amplessimus) and [anOS](https://github.com/Ampless/anos)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot, as always (nothing specific rn)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that sounds interesting to me (a little too many things)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with memory management (I read 10 pages of ARM docs and my brain went up in flames)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter @nichtchrissx](https://twitter.com/nichtchrissx), @chrissx:matrix.org (Signal if you know me)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them (or she/her)

I plan to write a proper profile _some_ time in the future, but idk when that will be.
