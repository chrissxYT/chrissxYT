### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Amplessimus, no other bigger projects at the moment
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Macs to do what I am already doing on Windows & Linux.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that sounds interesting to me (something a little too much)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with low-level memory management (don't get how to setup page tables on ARMv8)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nichtchrissx)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them

I plan to write a proper profile _some_ time in the future, but idk when that will be.
